# 🚀 DSA-PRACTICE

Welcome to **DSA-PRACTICE** 👨‍💻  

This repository is dedicated to solving Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems on a daily basis.  
The main goal of this repo is to improve problem-solving skills, strengthen core concepts, and stay consistent with daily practice.

Here, DSA practice questions will be added regularly along with their optimized solutions.

# 📌 Prefix Sum

## ❓ Why Do We Need Prefix Sum?

Prefix Sum is used when we need to handle multiple range sum queries efficiently.

If we calculate the sum for every query using a loop, the time complexity becomes high when the number of queries increases.

To optimize this, we preprocess the array once and store cumulative sums in a separate array.  
After preprocessing, each range sum query can be answered in constant time.

### ⏱ Time Complexity

- Preprocessing: O(n)  
- Each Query: O(1)
